### Description
Tired of the same basic sizes of Media Player?
Don't want to download tons of custom models? Then this addon is for you!
It uses props `YOU ALREADY HAVE` installed from vanilla Garry's Mod,
mounted Source games, and other workshop addons!
This addon aims to add easy development and more custom screens
and it is basically database extention for the base Garry's mod
media player addon.

### Requirements:
1. This extension needs the [base addon][ref-repo-base] to work so you can subscribe to it [here][ref-base].
2. The media player currently works only on `Chromium x64` branch for the game.

### Installation
You can clone this repository in your addons folder or subscribe to it [here][ref-mpext].

### Troubleshooting
When you are new to the media player or the videos are not loading
