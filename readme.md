### Description
This addon aims to add easy development and more custom screens
as a database extention for the base Garry's mod
media player addon.

Don't want to download tons of custom models? Then this addon is for you!
It uses props `YOU ALREADY HAVE` installed from vanilla game,
mounted Source games, and other workshop addons!

1. This extension needs the [base addon][ref-repo-base] to work so you can subscribe to it [here][ref-base].
2. The media player currently works only on [`Chromium x64`][ref-def-sw] branch of the game.
You can follow the development in [the official discord thead][ref-gmod-dc].

### Installation

### Troubleshooting
